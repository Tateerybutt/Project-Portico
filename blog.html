            <h4 class="title">Introducing "Science from the Qur’an" + Our Brand New Blog Page!</h4>

            <h3>As-salamu Alaikum and Welcome!</h3>
            <p>We’re thrilled to launch the <span style="color:#70d249">Science from the Qur’an</span> section — a
                powerful new
                addition to <span style="color:#70d249">Project Portico</span>! But that’s not all… we’ve also
                officially added a
                <b>dedicated Blog Page</b> to make exploring these gems even smoother and more engaging. 📖✨
            </p>

            <h3>What’s "Science from the Qur’an" All About?</h3>
            <p>In this section, we dive into some mind-blowing facts from modern science — and how they were already
                mentioned
                in the <span style="color:#70d249">Holy Qur’an</span> centuries ago. From astronomy and geology to
                biology and oceanography,
                this is all about reflecting on the divine wisdom that was always there, just waiting to be understood.
            </p>

            <h3>What to Expect in Each Post?</h3>
            <p><b>📘 Qur’anic Verse:</b> Every post highlights a clear verse with Arabic + English translation + proper
                reference.</p>
            <p><b>🔬 Modern Science:</b> We explain the scientific concept in simple words — so it clicks instantly!</p>
            <p><b>💭 Reflection:</b> A short discussion on how this verse inspires awe, curiosity, and deeper faith.</p>

            <h3>Why This Matters?</h3>
            <p>Because the Qur’an isn’t just a guide for the soul — it’s also a source of knowledge and observation.
                Allah ﷻ invites us again and again to "ponder", "reflect", and "observe". This section brings those
                verses to life.</p>

            <h3>Blog Page is LIVE!</h3>
            <p>With the launch of our new <b>Blog Page</b>, you can now explore all sections of Project Portico —
                including
                tools, thoughts, and spiritual gems — in one clean, scrollable experience. 🖥️📝
                It’s all styled with care, keeping simplicity and readability front and center.</p>

            <h3>Let’s Explore the Signs Together 🌌</h3>
            <p>If you’ve ever read a verse and thought, “Wait... science says that too?” — this is the spot for you.
                Whether you’re a curious student, a believer in awe, or someone exploring the intersection of deen and
                dunya,
                this section is made with love — and with you in mind.</p>

            <h3>Check It Out Now!</h3>
            <p>Tap into the Qur’an’s depth, beauty, and knowledge. Visit the new blog and explore the posts in the
                <span style="color:#70d249">Science from the Qur’an</span> series. More updates and posts are coming
                soon, inshaAllah!
            </p>

            <h3>JazakAllah Khair for Being Here</h3>
            <p><span style="color:#70d249">Project Portico</span> is just getting started, and your support means the
                world. Stay curious, stay inspired —
                and don’t forget to reflect on the ayahs that speak louder than textbooks 📚❤️</p>
